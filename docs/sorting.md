## Sorting Algorithms

### Bubble Sort

The most inefficient but basic sorting algorithm possible for array based structures.

### Selection Sort

This sorting algorithm runs in O(n<sup>2</sup>) time complexity. This algorithms,
finds the minimum element in a unsorted portion of the array and swaps it with the
first position of the unsorted part.
